# FizzBuzz

## Using File Reader version

there is a fizzbuzz.txt file that you can update if you wanted to use different inputs 

## Using hardcoded array version

there is a hardCodedArray declared in the index.js file that if you wanted to use this way instead you could comment out lines 6-10 in index. js and also uncomment the array on line 3 and also the function being invoked on line 53

both ways can simply use node index.js to run

## Using API endpoint

there is a super basic endpoint set up if you wanted to run node server.js and pop open Postman or some other API testing tool and hit localhost:3000/fizzbuzz with a POST request using raw text of a comma separate collection ie 1,2,a,15,etc... you should get the same logs as the other methods
